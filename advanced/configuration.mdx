title: '⚙️ Custom configurations'
---

Embedchain is made to work out of the box. However, for advanced users we're also offering configuration options. All of these configuration options are optional and have sane defaults.

## Concept
The main `App` class is available in the following varieties: `CustomApp`, `OpenSourceApp` and `Llama2App` and `App`. The first is fully configurable, the others are opinionated in some aspects.

The `App` class has three subclasses: `llm`, `db` and `embedder`. These are the core ingredients that make up an EmbedChain app.
App plus each one of the subclasses have a `config` attribute.
You can pass a `Config` instance as an argument during initialization to persistently configure a class.
These configs can be imported from `embedchain.config`

There are `set` methods for some things that should not (only) be set at start-up, like `app.db.set_collection_name`.

## Examples

### General

Here's the readme example with configuration options.

```python
from embedchain import App
from embedchain.config import AppConfig, AddConfig, LlmConfig, ChunkerConfig

# Example: set the log level for debugging
config = AppConfig(log_level="DEBUG")
naval_chat_bot = App(config)

# Example: specify a custom collection name
naval_chat_bot.db.set_collection_name("naval_chat_bot")

# Example: define your own chunker config for `youtube_video`
chunker_config = ChunkerConfig(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=100, length_function=len)
# Example: Add your chunker config to an AddConfig to actually use it
add_config = AddConfig(chunker=chunker_config)
naval_chat_bot.add("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qHkcs3kG44", config=add_config)

# Example: Reset to default
add_config = AddConfig()
naval_chat_bot.add("https://navalmanack.s3.amazonaws.com/Eric-Jorgenson_The-Almanack-of-Naval-Ravikant_Final.pdf", config=add_config)
naval_chat_bot.add("https://nav.al/feedback", config=add_config)
naval_chat_bot.add("https://nav.al/agi", config=add_config)
naval_chat_bot.add(("Who is Naval Ravikant?", "Naval Ravikant is an Indian-American entrepreneur and investor."), config=add_config)

# Change the number of documents.
query_config = LlmConfig(number_documents=5)
print(naval_chat_bot.query("What unique capacity does Naval argue humans possess when it comes to understanding explanations or concepts?", config=query_config))
```

### Custom prompt template

Here's the example of using custom prompt template with `.query`

```python
from string import Template

import wikipedia

from embedchain import App
from embedchain.config import LlmConfig

einstein_chat_bot = App()

# Embed Wikipedia page
page = wikipedia.page("Albert Einstein")
einstein_chat_bot.add(page.content)

# Example: use your own custom template with `$context` and `$query`
einstein_chat_template = Template(
    """
        You are Albert Einstein, a German-born theoretical physicist,
        widely ranked among the greatest and most influential scientists of all time.

        Use the following information about Albert Einstein to respond to
        the human's query acting as Albert Einstein.
        Context: $context

        Keep the response brief. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

        Human: $query
        Albert Einstein:"""
)
# Example: Use the template, also add a system prompt.
llm_config = LlmConfig(template=einstein_chat_template, system_prompt="You are Albert Einstein.")
queries = [
    "Where did you complete your studies?",
    "Why did you win nobel prize?",
    "Why did you divorce your first wife?",
]
for query in queries:
    response = einstein_chat_bot.query(query, config=llm_config)
    print("Query: ", query)
    print("Response: ", response)

# Output
# Query:  Where did you complete your studies?
# Response:  I completed my secondary education at the Argovian cantonal school in Aarau, Switzerland.
# Query:  Why did you win nobel prize?
# Response:  I won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for my services to Theoretical Physics, particularly for my discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.
# Query:  Why did you divorce your first wife?
# Response:  We divorced due to living apart for five years.
```
